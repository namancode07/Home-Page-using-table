          <h2>What is Web Designing?</h2>
          Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and
          implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is
          functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is
          central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of
          elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web
          designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the
          website that people interact with, so that the website is simple and
          efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and
          looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how
          well the website is designed.

          <h2>Key Benefits of Having a Good Web Design</h2>
          <p>
            A good web design can transform how your brand speaks to your
            audience. Organizations focus on their web design more than ever and
            look for professional web designers for the apparent benefits it can
            offer. Some of these benefits include:

          <h2>Web Design Vs. Web Development</h2>
          <p>
            Web design and web development are two terms that are often used
            interchangeably. However, they both mean two different things, have
            different purposes, and require a different set of skills to be
            implemented on a website. Web design is more about the experiential
            side of a website that ensures the audience finds the website
            useful, immersive, and engaging. It is highly intuitive based on the
            expectations of the users and uses this knowledge of user
            expectations to ensure an excellent user experience. Web
            development, on the other hand, involves building and maintaining a
            website with the help of coding systems so that the website
            functions smoothly with no glitches.
